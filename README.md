# Models of Random Genetic and Epigenetic Mutations (IISER Pune)

The interplay of heritable epigenetic changes with genetic changes can provide vital insights into the pace at which populations adapt to their surroundings.

In the summer of 2017, I worked with [Dr. Sutirth Dey](https://sites.google.com/a/acads.iiserpune.ac.in/sdlab/sutirth) at the Population Biology Lab at Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, Pune. Here, I wrote code to replicate a quantitative model proposed by [Collins et. al](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/wiley/how-epigenetic-mutations-can-affect-genetic-evolution-model-and-U8R7RV0UR4). This model simulated genetic and epigenetic mutations in Wright-Fischer populations, and measured their effects on population fitness, rates of adaptation, and other related parameters. 

This repository documents my code for the model.
